### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Ã‡ukurova University Computer Engineering Department in 2021. During my education, I have improved myself in research, self-motivation, entrepreneurship and acquiring different skills. As you can see in my resume, I prepared myself for business life with different trainings and individual studies. I would like to state that I am extremely self-sacrificing and enthusiastic about being effective and fast in business life, and in addition, I will undertake the responsibility required by the position with curiosity and enthusiasm. I am aware that willing, attentive and careful work will definitely bring success. For this reason, I have no doubt that I will be able to contribute to you with my skills and work discipline. Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and review my Github.
